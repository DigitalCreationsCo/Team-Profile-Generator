### Description

A Node CLI (command line interface) that takes employee information and generates an HTML summary page. This is a server-side application. 


### Approach

Breaking down the requirements, I separated out the objective into the following parts:

1. Define a constructor for the base employee, then extend it into the three employee types
2. Create html templates for each employee type
3. Using the command line, prompt the team leader to enter their information
4. Once the team leader is added, begin adding team members
5. Using the list of team members, generate the html page containing all members of the team
